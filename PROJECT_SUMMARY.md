## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) Implementation
- **Device Scanning:** Scans for all BLE devices (no filter for maximum compatibility)
- **GATT Connection:** Manages connection lifecycle with detailed logging

  - Cycling Power Service (0x1818)
  - Cycling Speed and Cadence Service (0x1816)
  - Heart Rate Service (0x180D)
  - Fitness Machine Service (0x1826) - for resistance control

### 2. Data Parsing
Implements Bluetooth SIG specifications for:
- **Power Measurement:** Instantaneous power in watts
- **Cadence Calculation:** From crank revolution data (RPM)

  - Red dashed line indicating current workout position
  - Dynamic Y-axis scaling (110% of max resistance for better visibility)

### 4. Workout Programming & Execution
- **Custom Workouts:** Create multi-interval resistance profiles
- **Interval Configuration:**
  - Set total workout duration in minutes
  - Add intervals with duration (minutes) and target resistance (%)
  - Validation ensures intervals sum to total duration
  - Input fields disabled when workout is complete
- **Workout Execution:**
  - CountDownTimer for precise interval transitions

## How It Works

### Basic Training Flow

1. **Startup:**
   - App launches, checks Bluetooth availability
   - Initializes KickrBluetoothService
   - Sets up UI observers and chart configurations

2. **Scanning:**
   - User taps "Scan for Devices"
   - App checks/requests Bluetooth permissions
   - BLE scanner starts (scans all devices for maximum compatibility)
   - Discovered devices populate RecyclerView

3. **Connection:**
   - User taps a device from the list
   - App connects via GATT
   - Discovers available services (with detailed logging)
   - Subscribes to notifications for all relevant characteristics
   - Initializes charts (power, speed)

4. **Real-Time Data Flow:**
   - Kickr sends BLE notifications with measurement data
   - KickrBluetoothService parses binary data per Bluetooth spec
   - Updates StateFlow with new TrainerData
   - MainActivity observes Flow and updates:
     - Numeric displays (power, cadence, speed, HR)
     - Power chart (last 20 seconds, rolling window)
     - Speed chart (last 20 seconds, rolling window)
   - Charts update smoothly with new data points

### Workout Programming Flow

5. **Workout Setup:**
   - User taps "Setup Workout" button
   - WorkoutSetupActivity launches
   - User enters workout name
   - User sets total duration in minutes
   - User adds intervals:
     - Duration in minutes (converted to seconds internally)
     - Target resistance percentage
   - App validates intervals sum to total duration
   - Add button disabled when duration fully allocated
   - User can save workout profile with custom name
   - Saved workouts stored as JSON in SharedPreferences

6. **Workout Execution:**
   - User taps "Start Workout" after configuration
   - Intent passes workout data to MainActivity
   - Workout status card becomes visible (blue background)
   - Resistance profile chart displays entire workout:
     - X-axis: Time in seconds
     - Y-axis: Resistance % (scaled to 110% of max)
     - Blue filled area showing step function of resistance
   - CountDownTimer starts:
     - Fires every second
     - Updates elapsed/remaining time display
     - Updates current interval information
     - Sends resistance commands at interval transitions
     - Updates red dashed progress line on chart
   - Resistance control:
     - Tries Wahoo proprietary protocol first
     - Falls back to FTMS Target Power
     - Falls back to FTMS Resistance Level
     - Falls back to Cycling Power Control Point
     - All attempts logged for debugging

7. **Workout Management:**
   - **Load:** Opens dialog showing all saved workout names
     - Select workout → shows Load/Delete options
     - Load: Restores workout configuration to UI
     - Delete: Confirmation dialog → removes from storage
   - **Save:** Stores current workout with entered name
   - Multiple workouts can be saved and managed

8. **Disconnect:**
   - User taps "Disconnect" or "Stop Workout"
